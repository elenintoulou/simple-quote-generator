# simple-quote-generator

A simple quote generator to practise html, css and Javascript.

A small, cute project to start delving into fully functional projects.
It's simple, fun, cute and visually playful!

You press a button and generates an inspirational quote!
I also added a little animation with falling flowers to give the page some life ðŸŒ¸
As I continue learning full-stack development, I plan to update and expand the project.

### Notes:
- add more languages in the future
- add a daily quote notification feature
